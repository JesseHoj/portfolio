## Work Experience
With 13 years of experience at an international accounting firm within the internal Technology Services department, I have developed a robust understanding of the importance of data in driving key business decisions. Throughout my tenure, I have taken on various roles that focused on the strategic vision of collaborative platforms for our 4,000-person firm. My responsibilities included product ownership for several key applications used by our 40,000 client users. These experiences have equipped me with the skills to leverage data effectively in any decision-making process. Ultimately, my goal is to transition into government or higher education environments where I can focus on social policy issues.

## This Portfolio
This portfolio is designed to catalog my work during my Master of Arts in Social Research and Analysis program. My primary focus will be on utilizing secondary data sources to provide insightful analysis on various social issues. As my coursework progresses, I will also include examples of survey research, interviews, focus groups, and other data collection strategies. This portfolio will serve as a comprehensive record of my academic journey and showcase my ability to apply research methodologies to impact social policy.
